#### Reading I

INTRODUCTION:
    Algorithms in general.

    Why are they important, and how can algorithmic ingenuity improve over straightforward solutions?

    Merge Sort Algorithm
        Practical and famous - everyone should know it
        Good warm up for more intricate material
        Canonical introduction to the "divide and conquer" algorithm design paradigm


ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS:
    Big-Oh notation and its relatives
    
    Identify a "sweet spot" of granularity for reasoning about algorithms:
        - Suppress second-order details like constant factors and lower-order terms
        - Focus on how the running time scales as input size grows
